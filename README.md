## Instructions
This is the Memory Game. Can you match all the cards to each other? How fast and in how few moves can you win?

## HOW TO PLAY:

1) Once the page is loaded start clicking cards.
2) When you have a match the cards will turn yellow. This designates a complete match.
3) Once all cards have been matched you will receive a victory popup detailing your time of completion, star (difficulty rating), and a number of moves taken for victory.
